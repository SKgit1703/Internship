Implementation Details
Document Ingestion:
● Loading Documents from PDFs:
The process begins with loading documents from PDF files using the PyPDFLoader.
This component is crucial for extracting text from each page of the PDF, converting the
document into a raw text format. The extracted text serves as the foundation for
subsequent processing steps, ensuring that the document's content is accurately captured
and ready for analysis.
● Text Splitting Strategy:
Once the text is extracted, it's passed through the
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which is responsible for dividing the text
into smaller, manageable chunks. Each chunk typically contains around 1500 characters,
with some overlap between consecutive chunks. This overlap is important to preserve
context across the text segments, ensuring that the meaning and flow of information are
maintained. This method is particularly useful for handling long documents, allowing for
efficient processing and retrieval while ensuring that the integrity of the content is not
compromised.
Indexing:
● Creating a Vector Store with FAISS:
The next step involves creating a vector store using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity
Search). FAISS is leveraged to convert the text chunks into vector embeddings, a process
done using models like sentence-transformers. These embeddings capture the
semantic meaning of each chunk, enabling the system to perform similarity searches
based on context rather than just keywords. The vector embeddings are stored in an
efficient index, allowing for quick retrieval of contextually similar documents when a
query is made.
● Indexing Documents with Whoosh:
In parallel, a textual index is created using Whoosh, a keyword-based search library.
Unlike FAISS, which focuses on semantic similarity, Whoosh allows for fast,
keyword-based searches. This dual indexing strategy ensures that both semantically
relevant and keyword-matching documents are retrievable, enhancing the system's ability
to deliver accurate results.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
● Initializing the RAG Model:
The RAG model is initialized using components from HuggingFace, including
RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, and RagSequenceForGeneration. These
components work together to facilitate the model's ability to generate responses based on
retrieved documents. The RagTokenizer converts the input queries and retrieved
documents into tokens that the model can process. The RagRetriever interacts with
the vector and textual indices to fetch relevant documents, while the
RagSequenceForGeneration generates coherent answers based on the retrieved
context.
● Generating Answers with RAG:
The RAG model uses a combination of semantic and textual search results to generate
answers. After the relevant documents are retrieved by FAISS and Whoosh, these results
are fed into the RAG model. The model processes the combined context and generates a
response that is both relevant and contextually appropriate to the user's query. This
approach ensures that the answers are grounded in the retrieved documents, providing a
high level of accuracy and relevance.
Query Processing:
● Processing Queries:
The query processing logic is designed to handle both semantic and textual searches
efficiently. When a query is made, it is processed in two stages:
○ Semantic Search: The query is matched against the vector embeddings in the
FAISS index, retrieving documents that are contextually similar.
○ Textual Search: Simultaneously, the query is matched against the textual index in
Whoosh, retrieving documents based on keyword matching.
● The results from both searches are then combined and ranked, forming the context for the
RAG model to generate the final answer. This dual approach ensures that the system
considers both the meaning and the specific keywords in the query, delivering more
accurate results.
Conversational Chain Logic:
● Maintaining Conversation History:
The system maintains a history of the conversation, which is used to enhance the context
of subsequent queries. This history helps the system understand the flow of the dialogue
and ensures that responses remain consistent across multiple turns. If the generated
answer is not satisfactory, fallback prompts are employed to guide the user in rephrasing
the query. This conversational chain logic is crucial for handling multi-turn dialogues
effectively, ensuring a smooth and coherent interaction with the user
